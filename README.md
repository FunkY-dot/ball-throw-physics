# ball-throw-physics
the all new and upcoming special program that calculates where a ball would land based on some parameters, now written in rust! (im overhyping this)


this is gonna have some over-explaining documentation since i am a COMPLETE beginner to rust. this whole ass project is all supposed to be mostly for learning and because i like physics. stuff like what stuff are and special little rules that i gather while coding. anyways to the 2 people if even that who are reading this right now, please correct me im up to learn.
